## Overview
This project implements a ShoppingCart class using modern C# 6, 7, or 8. The project can be completed 
using the free community version of Visual Studio available here: 
* [https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) 

The goal is to implement the ShoppingCart class using an in-memory collection of Products (e.g. `IEnumerable<Product>`) such 
that **all of the provided unit tests pass**. There is no need to implement a DB schema, command line 
interface, graphical interface etc.

Feel free to introduce abstractions/classes where you think they will be useful in implementing the ShoppingCart class.

**Estimated time:** 1-3 hours, but there is no hard time limit

**Note:** No forking or pull requests please!! We don't want your solution to be made public on 
github. Please download the repo as a zip file, and submit your completed solution as a zip file 
to daniel.packard@complexrehabsystems.com


## Details
Download this repository, and open `ShoppingCart_Interview.sln` in visual studio. You should be able to build the solution, and run all of the unit tests. Initially, every unit test will fail. 

The project is complete when all of the [unit tests](https://github.com/complexrehabsystems/ShoppingCart_Interview/blob/master/ShoppingCart_Interview/Test/When_adding_and_removing_items_to_a_shopping_cart.cs)
pass. 

The unit tests specify the following funcitonality in detail:
* add products to the cart
* remove products from the cart
* remove everything from the cart
* query if the cart is empty
* query if the cart contains any of a given product
* query how many of a given product the cart contains
* query the total value (in $) of the items in the cart

sample usage:

``` c#
var apple = new Product() {Name = "apple", Price = 25};
var banana = new Product() {Name = "banana", Price = 15};
var pineapple = new Product() {Name = "pineapple", Price = 55};

var cart = new ShoppingCart();
cart.IsEmpty(); // returns true

cart.AddProduct(banana, 3);
cart.IsEmpty();               // returns false
cart.Contains(banana);        // returns true
cart.Quantity(banana);        // returns 3
cart.Contains(apple);         // returns false
cart.Total();                 // returns 45 (15 * 3)

cart.AddProduct(pineapple, 1);
cart.Contains(pineapple);     // returns true
cart.Total();                 // returns 100 (15 * 3 + 55)

cart.RemoveProduct(banana, 1);// removes one banana
cart.Quantity(banana);        // returns 2
cart.RemoveProduct(banana);   // removes all bananas
cart.Quantity(banana);        // returns 0;

cart.RemoveAll();
cart.IsEmpty();               // returns true;
```

## Senior developers, please address at least two of the following (no code required, just discuss): 
- A) Are there any ways you would suggest changing the specification/tests?
- B) Suggest unit tests that you think should be added.
- C) Propose a way to add the concept of a Discount to the ShoppingCart 
  - e.g. a percentage discount off the cart total, buy one get one free, etc
  - No need to _implement_ Discounts -- this is just to gain insight into your software design thought process.
- D) Propose a database schema that would support the operations used here
  - what if you want to review an old order, but prices have been updated?

## Tips and Best Practices

* Use modern C# idioms wherever possible (LINQ, lambda expressions, expression body members, etc)
* Avoid using imperative style (loops, if/else, etc)
* Avoid nested logic and unnecessary branching
* When suggesting new tests, especially try to think of edge cases 
  * (e.g. what should happen if you try to remove something that is not in the cart? What happens if you try to remove more items than the cart contains?)
* Please take time to refactor if you have duplicated logic
* Optimize for readability/maintainability over performance.
