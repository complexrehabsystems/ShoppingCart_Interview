This project implements a simple shopping cart in C#, and can be completed using the free community version of Visual Studio 2015 available here: [https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?pid=1881](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?pid=1881) 

Using an instance of the ShoppingCart class, you should be able to:
* add products to the cart 
* remove products from the cart
* ask the cart if it is empty 
* ask the cart if it contains any of a given products
* ask the cart how many of any given product it contains

These operations are specified in more detail with a set of unit tests explaining how the shopping cart will behave in different situations.

To complete this project, you should:
1. download the source code
2. verify the solution builds
3. verify the unit test suite runs
  * there should be 2 passing tests and 10 skipped tests
4. view the test file under the Test directory. Many of the tests will be annotated with the Ignore attribute. 
5. remove the [Ignore] attribute from one test at a time, implementing enough code to make it pass before moving on to the next test.

After implementing code to fix all of the unit tests, please:
1. suggest unit tests that you think should be added
2. propose a way to modify the cart to support a buy-one-get-one-free discount.
